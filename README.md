Alzheimerâ€™s disease is an uncurable brain disorder,
mostly from the age of 65 or older, that slowly destroys memory
and thinking skills, including memory problems, confusion,
difficulty thinking, and changes in language, behavior, and
personality. Effective, innovative and cost effective early diagnosis
can reduce damage to nerve cells. It is possible to detect this
symptom from the voice response from the candidate and then
use the corresponding transcript in data analysis. This study
involves the use of LLM to overcome data limitation, BERT
embedding and Machine learning techniques to classify text to
identify the disease. HPCC Systems Platform from LexisNexis
Risk Solutions is one of the finest platforms for maintaining data-
lake and its parallel computing power helps in faster processing
of machine learning model training. This paper will demonstrate
how an open-source platform can be used for text classification to
identify a disease, by means of fast, inexpensive and non-invasive
techniques to complement other related diagnostic methods.
